  - invisible says: You find a pack of batteries and you check the date to find that it is 4 years old.
  - invisible says: Should you keep it?
  - choice:
    - Yes!, It should be good enough.:
      - invisible says: No you shouldn't, a battery's average life span is 3 to 5 years.
      - invisible says: You should go to the store and buy new batteries.
    - Of course invisible says:ible says: Yes, you should go to the store and buy new batteries as a battery's average life span is 3 to 5 hours.
  - invisible says: You find an air horn and some glowsticks which seems silly.
  - invisible says: Should you keep it? 
  - choice:
    - Yeah could be useful or fun:
      - invisible says: An air horn can be used for signaling so other people would be able to know where to look for you!
      - invisible says: Also glowsticks can be a good source of light in case of failure of electric equipment.
    - No that's ridiclous, GET RID OF IT!:
      - invisible says: Actually an air horn is pretty useful, it can be used for signaling so other people would be able to know where to look for you!
      - invisible says: Also glowsticks can be a good source of light in case of failure of electric equipment.
  - invisible says: Your powerbanks are at 50%
  - invisible says: Should you charge them?
  - choice:
    - Yeah, sounds reasonable.:
      - invisible says: You're right, having them fully charged will allow you to charge electronic devices without the use of wall outlets.
      - invisible says: And who knows? You may not have power for a while due to potentially fallen powerlines.
    - Nah, it should last the duration of the tornado.:
      - invisible says: You should charge them!!! You may not have power for a while due to potentially fallen powerlines.
      - invisible says: Having them fully charged will allow you to charge electronic devices without the use of wall outlets.
  - invisible says: You check your First Aid Kit and you notice that you are lacking bandages!
  - invisible says: Should you go buy some from the local pharmacy?
  - choice:
    - Yeah, makes sense to me:
      - invisible says: Correct!
      - invisible says: Stocking up on a sufficent amount of medical supplies is very important so that you can be prepared for any emergency. 
    - Nah, I'll make do with what I have.:
      - invisible says: No you should go buy bandages!
      - invisible says: Stocking up on a sufficent amount of medical supplies is very important so that you can be prepared for any emergency. 
  - invisible says: You find canned food that expires next year.
  - invisible says: Should you throw it out?
  - choice:  
    - Yeah, seems a bit icky!:
      - invisible says: No, the canned food is totally fine. No need to waste perfectly good food.
    - Why would I? It's alright to eat:
      - invisible says: You're absolutely correct! No need to waste perfectly good food.
  - invisible says: You find an radio. Should you keep it or chuck it?
  - choice:
    - Keep it, it could be helpful!:
      - invisible says: You're absultey right!
      - invisible says: The radio can be used to tune into emergency relief stations to hear what citizens should be doing.
    - Nah, chuck that junk outta here!:
      - invisible says: What are you doing?!?! Keep the darn thing.
      - invisible says: The radio can be used to tune into emergency relief stations to hear what citizens should be doing.

  - show invisible: normal
  - invisible says: It's been a few hours and it sounds quiet. Should you go upstairs to check what it looks like outside?
  - choice:
    - Why not? There I don't hear anything outside, therefore nothing is happening.:
      - invisible says: You shouldn't go up!
      - invisible says: Even though it might be silent doesn't mean that the tornado isn't still around! You should listen closely to the radio for further instructions.
    - No, doesn't seem like a good idea...:
      - invisible says: You're absoutely right!
      - invisible says: You should listen closely to the radio for further instructions.
  - invisible says: You and your family are all wearing old bicycle helmets but your little sister says it feels uncomfortable. Do you let her take the helmet off?
  - choice:
    - Of course! You want all your family members to feel comfortable.:
      - invisible says: Don't let her take off the helmet. There is a possiblty that your secure structure can fail.
      - invisible says: If so, potential debri can enter, the helmet acts as a layer of protection for your head.
    - Don't let her, let her know it's for her safety.:
      - invisible says: That is the correct approach! There is a possiblty that your secure structure can fail.
      - invisible says: If so, potential debri can enter, the helmet acts as a layer of protection for your head.

  - invisible says: The storm is finally over and you are about to walk outside with sneakers. Is this okay?
  - choice:
    - Why wouldn't it be? Sneakers are all-purpose shoes.:
      - invisible says: No that would be terrible. You would need to wear hard-soled shoes to avoid stepping on potentially sharp debris like broken glass.
    - No way, sounds a bit risky.:
      - invisible says: You are right! Wearing hard-soled shoes could help you avoid stepping on potentially sharp debris like broken glass.
